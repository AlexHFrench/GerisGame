Toy project - Creating a chess program

## Introduction

This is my first actual program (outside of courses and problems, etc.)
I chose chess because I enjoy the game and wanted to work on something that matched my personal interests.

I also thought it would provide a rich place to start as a problem space and have many potential features
to itteratively add as I progress in my skills, all the way up to eventually experimenting with ML.

## Design

### Scope..
The primary purpose of the project was to develop basic skills and get my teeth into building a "real" project from scratch.

As a result the overall ethos was "if it will run, that is good enough" and function took precedence over time and space efficiency, for example.
